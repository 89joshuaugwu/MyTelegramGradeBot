so from the following are the fixes i tried concerning the login with multiple AIs like copilot, deepseek, grok and replit but the only works is the my_telegram_bot.py which was fixed by replit AI so now if i run the my_telegram_bot.py it works well and the teacher login works so check and analyze why that one works and the rest do not work then delete the rest and then rename it to JoshuazazaBot.py and check if any updates is needed

ok i created an assignment like what the meaning of WWW?
so i wrote World Wide Web as the answer 
but as a students i enter "the full meaning of WWW is World Wide Web" i do get 75% but if i put "World Wide Web" i do get 100% in the AI question mode 
also i have question is it possible to integrate gemini AI maybe with the germin API keys since the initial open AI was not free but i thing germini is free so analyze if it can be implemented but check the answer first 
also check every other question mode if properly implemented
